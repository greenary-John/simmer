for cool, new composite search:
annSetChoice parameter would have to be a list (if multiple provided)
evCodesChoice parameter would have to be a list (if multiple sets provided)
namespaceChoice parameter would have to be a list (if multiple provided)
methodChoice parameter would have to be a list (if multiple provided)

consider adding an optional parameter to SS methods to return all results, regardless of length 
	consider using a dictionary?

in html format, have multiple columns
	ex:	composite	Resnik BMA	Extended GIC	Extended Jaccard

note: in case of all three SS measures being incorporated (probably not advised, to be honest)
weight GIC and JAC lesser individually such that returned results are not dominated by groupwise approach
